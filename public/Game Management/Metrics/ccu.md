# Concurrent Users (CCUs)

You will soon be able to view Concurrent Users from the metrics dashboards. These metrics will include the numbers of concurrent players and the particular UGC being played at any one time.   

Weâ€™re currently documenting this feature, but please [reach out](mailto:developers@mod.io) if you have questions in the meantime.
